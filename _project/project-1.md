<h2><b><a href="https://lucid-borg-00ad57.netlify.app/"> Zesty - Web Application Development project</a> </b></h2>
<div>
<p>
- Utilized HTML and JavaScript to build out all the features for this web application, then incorporated CSS to style all the page components.<br>
- Used figma to create initial designs.<br>
- Worked with a recipe API to get recipe datas that match the user’s search criteria.<br>

<h2><b>Traffic Lights</b></h2>
<div>
<p>
- Implemented and utilized semaphores in a C program that simulates cars sharing a single lane that requires a synchronization.<br>
- Solved the race condition by adding synchronization directives to cause cars to wait for the others.<br>
