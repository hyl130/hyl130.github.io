Hi! I am Hyunjo and I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am graduating in June of 2023 with a degree in Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. My primary technical languages are Java and Python. I have several experiences with C++, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

When I am not coding, I'm probably exploring new places and taking pictures. I love listening to music and dancing during my free time!

Why me?
======
With my previous internship and class project experiences in an Agile development environment, I was able to lead the group and further develop not only my technical skills, but also team management skills. By developing software solutions, I have explored various algorithms, data structure and debugging skills. Especially through my recent internship experience, I was able to apply my problem solving skills to automate the companyâ€™s internal tool by migrating the manual workflow into an automation. The process that initially took the entire two weeks for the company was completed within 6 minutes with my software solution. I also engaged in making different test cases to assure the quality of my software product. As I want to further pursue my interest in developing flawless quality products, I want to deliver quality end-user facing products by working closely with a team of high-performance engineers, designers, and a product manager.
