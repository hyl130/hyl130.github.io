Hey there! I'm Hyunjo, a passionate full stack engineer with a love for creating innovative software solutions. I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), graduating in June 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I thrive in cross-functional teams and excel in Agile development environments. Collaborating with diverse professionals, I enjoy designing, developing, testing, and deploying high-quality software. My primary technical languages are Java and Python, and I also have experience with C++, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

I've tackled challenging projects throughout my academic and professional journey. From automating manual workflows to building web and mobile applications, I've sharpened my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. My strong foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics enables me to leverage a range of programming languages and web technologies like HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and React Native to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces.

Beyond coding, I love exploring new places and capturing moments through photography. And when I'm not doing that, you might find me dancing in the world of music during my free time.

As a 2023 New Graduate, I'm actively seeking entry-level Full-Stack Software Engineer opportunities. I'm excited to bring my skills, knowledge, and passion to a forward-thinking organization that values innovation and fosters a collaborative work environment.
