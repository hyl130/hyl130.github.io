Hi! I am Hyunjo and I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am graduating in June of 2023 with a degree in Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. My primary technical languages are Java and Python. I have several experiences with C++, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

When I am not coding, I'm probably exploring new places and taking pictures. I love listening to music and dancing during my free time!

Why me?
======
With my previous internship and class project experiences, I was able to lead the group and further develop not only my technical skills, but also team management skills. Over the last few years at UC San Diego, I have explored various algorithms, data structure and debugging skills.
Especially through my recent web development project, I was able to participate in pair programming, fix the bugs on our product, get the API call to work, and grow as a leader.
