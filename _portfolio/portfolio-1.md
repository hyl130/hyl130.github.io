I developed a web application that searches and saves a recipe for cooking beginners. Using the Spoonacular data API, I was able fetch all the recipe information. I developed both desktop and mobile version of the website by using <b>Javascript, HTML, and CSS</b>. To enhance the front end of the website, <b>React</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b> was used. The application is hosted on Netify serverless cloud platform as a static web content. To save user's favorite recipe and their customized recipe information, DOM local storage was used.
